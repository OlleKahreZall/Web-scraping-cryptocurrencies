# Web scraping project - extract data from the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies

In this project, I have scraped the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap from  https://coinmarketcap.com/. Information such as the daily volume, market cap, values when the stock market opened/closed, etc., for each cryptocurrency have been extracted. This spider has fetched each cryptocurrency's data from its first day were documented on the stock market (according to https://coinmarketcap.com/) to the 2nd of December. In total, more than 800 000 data points have been extracted.
